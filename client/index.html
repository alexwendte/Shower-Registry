        <h3>A note from the happy couple:</h3>
        <p>Hey all! This is a little different than a normal registry, but we realize that as college students, money can be super tight.  We are hoping to instead do a "Fill the Pantry". This is to help us get essential items that will give us a good start on our lives together, and also gives you all the opportunity to help us with things that will add up to a lot of money, without having to spend as much (but feel free to get however many items you want to haha)! </p>

      <div class="right">
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <p>We indicated what the item is, a picture of the item, a quantity desired, and a quantity purchased. If you all could fill in the quantity purchased when you get things, that would be great!</p>
        <p>The wedding shower is on Saturday April 14th at 901 Bertrand Street.</p>
